# Shipment Tracking System

Welcome to the Shipment Tracking System project! This is a web application that allows you to track and manage shipments. It provides a user-friendly interface to view shipment details, filter shipments, and perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on shipments.

## ðŸš€ Introducing the NEW Server Feature!

Now, my project comes with a robust server for seamless data retrieval from various endpoints

## Known issue

**Local File Option:** In case of faulty endpoints

you can leverage our local file reading feature. Simply follow these steps:
   - Place the data you need in a local file.
   - Configure the server to read from the local file instead of the endpoint.
   - Enjoy uninterrupted data access!
